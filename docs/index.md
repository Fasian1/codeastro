# Program Description

​Code/Astro is a week-long astronomy software development workshop. The goal of this program is to teach students fundamental software engineering skills and best practices for building sustainable open-source packages for astronomy applications. During the workshop, students will obtain hands-on experience with software engineering by developing a small software package from scratch. The workshop will also serve as a networking and career development opportunity. Due to the current pandemic, the inaugural Code/Astro will be held remotely. Code/Astro is supported by the Heising-Simons Foundation.

# How to Apply

We require participants to be familiar with Python or another high-level programming language (e.g., Java, Matlab). Students are expected to develop on their own computers and have set up their development environment there. The workshop will be held online via video conferencing. For students that require financial assistance in any way to participate, please contact Jason Wang (jwang4@caltech.edu), as we have some funding support available. Anyone related to astronomy is eligible. 

**Applications have closed for 2020.**
